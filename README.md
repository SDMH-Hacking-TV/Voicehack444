Capturing audio (.wav) from target using a link

![hello](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34893261/66277580-c7f4b980-e876-11e9-9d05-e3170ad9278e.png)

### How it works?

After the user grants microphone permissions, a website redirect button of your choice is released to distract the target while small audio files (about 4 seconds in wav format) are sent to the attacker.
It uses Recorderjs, plugin for recording/exporting the output of Web Audio API nodes .

### Features:

Port Forwarding using Serveo or Ngrok
